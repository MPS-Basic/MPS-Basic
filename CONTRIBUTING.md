5. Your pull request will be reviewed and merged if at least one maintainer approves it.

## Guidelines

- **C++ Standard**: We adhere to C++17.
- **Exceptions**: Do **NOT** use exceptions.
- **Macros**:
  - Defined in `common.hpp`.
  - Excessive use should be avoided.
  - **Use range-based for `for (auto& e : v)` instead of `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) `, whenever it is possible**.
- **Declaration of namespace**:
  - Should be minimum to prevent conflicts.
  - Defined in each `cpp` files. Do **not** write it in `hpp` files to prevent spreading of the declaration.
  - Do **not** declare entire name space. `using namespace std; // not good`
  - You can declare a function if that's commonly used. `using std::cout; // not bad`
  - You are **recommended** to rename long namespace, instead of declaring it. `namespace fs = std::filesystem; // good`
  - Currently approved declarations:
    - `using std::cout;`
    - `using std::endl;`
    - `namespace fs = std::filesystem;`
    - `namespace chrono = std::chrono;`
  - Curretnly **prohibited** declarations:
    - `using namespace std;`
    - `using namespace Eigen;`: to let beginers know Eigen is used
    - `using std::vector`: not to be confused with `Vector` in Eigen
